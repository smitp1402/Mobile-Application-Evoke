# Mobile Application:Evoke

# OBJECTIVE
This application has made to increase curiosity towards learning in online education domain for 1 to 6th grade students.Sometime student not able to grasp and visualize topic by reading.what if student would able to see the topic related 3D model in real worold.Definitely this will become more interesting and easier to learn any topic.So by integreting
